# Cross Bot 2.0 in NodeJS

# IMPORTANT: Deprecated

This bot will no longer be worked on due to a change in the Discord API. The main purpose of the bot was to piggyback off other bots commands for banning purposes. With the increased focus on /command oriented commands from discord, this bot will effectively no longer work with most main stream moderation bots.

In the event that bot developers switch back to message based commands instead of /commands, I may come back and work on the bot to get it into a deployable state. 

This bot uses Discord.js v12 and this version will be deprecated soon (as of 8/6/2021) rendering the code non working.

This was just a passion project with the hope of being useful, and to learn more about nodejs.
